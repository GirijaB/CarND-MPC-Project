## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Build with Docker-Compose
The docker-compose can run the project into a container
and exposes the port required by the simulator to run.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Build image: `docker-compose build`
3. Run Container: `docker-compose up`
4. On code changes repeat steps 2 and 3.

## Tips

1. The MPC is recommended to be tested on examples to see if implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, it tracks the reference line after some timesteps(not too many).
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has waypoints of the lake track. This could fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We have kept editor configuration files out of this repo to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

WriteUp:-

MODEL:-

The model used in MPC Project is a kinematic model that uses vehicle's coordinate(x,y), velocity(v), orientation(psi), cross track error(cte), orientation error(epsi).

A 3-degree polynomial were fitted to the waypoints sent from the server which were used to calculate the cte and epsi.

The car has two actuators, it can accelerate/brake, and steer.

The constraints were defined on following for minimizing the ot function:

cte
epsi
velocity

Constraints on the steering:

steering angle
throttle

Constraints in difference of the below steering actuators sequentially

steering angles
throttle
There was no special handling done to handle latency but the assumption is that adding a constraint for the differences in steering actuators soothes the values and keeps sequential values closer thus accounting for some latency.

Updated equations for this model are:

x1 = (x0 + v0 * cos(psi0) * dt)

y1 = (y0 + v0 * sin(psi0) * dt)

psi1 = (psi0 + v0 / Lf * delta0 * dt)

v1 = (v0 + a0 * dt)

cte1 = ((f0 - y0) + (v0 * sin(epsi0) * dt))

epsi1 = ((psi0 - psides0) + v0 * delta0 / Lf * dt)

In those equations v is speed, x and y are positional coordinates, psi is the orientation, delta is the steering angle, Lf the distance between the front of the vehicle and it center of gravity, a is the accelerator pedal actuation, psides is the desired orientation, cte is the cross track error, epsi is the orientation error and dt is the time step.

Checking timesteps & interval between timesteps
The N & the dt parameters (the timestamp length and the duration between timesteps) are constant for all.  Increasing the timesteps (N) parameter made the model less sensitive at higher velocities and caused the vehicle to veer out of the track on sharp turns. Decreasing the duration between timesteps (dt) parameter caused the vehicle to be over-sensitive and caused the vehicle to veer off courser at the start itself.I settled for having a step of 0,075 seconds and using 10 steps. This results in a modeled trajectory up to 0,75 second into the future.configuration also depends on latency.
